# Music Soundboard

## Overview
This project is a soundboard created using p5.js, designed to play various sounds through a grid of interactive buttons. Each button triggers a specific sound when clicked. The project utilizes p5.js for both the layout and sound functionality.

## Features
- **Interactive Button Grid**: A 3x3 grid of buttons, each associated with a different sound.
- **Sound Playback**: Each button, when clicked, plays a corresponding sound file.
- **Stop Sound**: Function to stop previous sound when new one is introduced.
- **Custom Styling**: All visual styling and layout are handled directly in the sketch.js file.

## Files
**sketch.js**: The main JavaScript file where all the functionality and styling are defined. It includes the setup for the p5.js canvas, button creation, and sound handling.

## Usage
1. **Load sketch.js**: The project runs directly from the sketch.js file. Make sure you have p5.js included in your HTML file or use the p5.js web editor.

2. **Add Your Sounds**: Replace the sound file paths in the sketch.js file with the paths to your own sound files.

3. **Run the Project**: Open your HTML file in a web browser or run the project through the p5.js web editor.

## Details

- **Layout and Styling**
The layout and styling of the buttons are handled directly within sketch.js. The file sets up a 3x3 grid of buttons and applies styling for spacing and alignment. Customizations to button size, spacing, and grid arrangement are also managed within this file.

- **Button Functionality**
Each button is linked to a sound file. Clicking a button will play the associated sound, with functionality defined within the sketch.js file.

## Example
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how the button grid is set up in sketch.js:

```javascript
class Button {
  constructor(x, y, w, h, color, accent, sound) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.w = w;
    this.h = h;
    this.color = color;
    this.accent = accent;
    this.sound = sound;
  }

  show() {
    noStroke();

    fill(this.color);
    rect((this.x - 100), this.y, this.w, 50);

    fill(this.accent);
    ellipse(this.x, this.y, this.w, this.h);

    fill(this.color);
    arc(this.x, (this.y + 50), this.w, this.h, TWO_PI, PI);
  }

  clicked(px, py) {
    let d = dist(px, py, this.x, this.y);

    if (d < this.w / 2) {
      this.y = this.y + 10;
      this.sound.play();
    }
  }

  stopSound() {
    if (this.sound.isPlaying()){
      this.sound.stop();
    }
  }
}
```
